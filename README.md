## Introduction

**TDS-Project-2** is an advanced solution designed to streamline the process of analyzing datasets, generating insights, and visualizing results with minimal user intervention. It supports a wide range of datasets and provides comprehensive reports, including statistical summaries, correlation analysis, and visualizations. Additionally, the tool leverages OpenAI's models to create detailed narrative insights based on the analysis outcomes.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


### Key Components:
1. **`autolysis.py`**: 
   - The central script for automating data analysis tasks.
   - Includes functions for reading, processing, and analyzing data.
   
2. **`goodreads/`**:
   - Contains tools for analyzing data related to books or Goodreads reviews.
   - Includes scripts for data scraping or sentiment analysis.

3. **`happiness/`**:
   - Focuses on analyzing happiness datasets (e.g., global happiness indices).
   - Provides insights or visualizations based on happiness scores.

4. **`media/`**:
   - Stores visual outputs (charts, graphs, etc.) or media-related files.

How to Use
1. Upload Dataset
To begin using the tool, simply upload your dataset. The system supports a variety of formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON.

2. Data Analysis
Once the dataset is uploaded, the tool will automatically load and begin the analysis. The following processes will be carried out:

Data Cleaning: The tool checks for missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.
Statistical Summaries: The system generates summary statistics for all numerical and categorical columns, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and more.
Correlation Analysis: The tool calculates correlation coefficients to reveal relationships between numerical variables.
Data Visualizations: Visualizations such as distribution plots, box plots, and heatmaps are generated for a better understanding of the data.
3. Insights & Reporting
After the analysis is complete, the tool will generate:

Statistical Summary Report: A detailed summary of all calculated statistics.
Visualizations: All generated charts are saved as PNG files for easy sharing and inclusion in reports.
Narrative Insights: Using OpenAIâ€™s models, the tool produces a written analysis summarizing key findings, trends, and insights from the data.
4. Save and Export
Once the analysis is complete, you can:

Download the statistical summary as a text or CSV file.
Download the generated visualizations as PNG files.
Export the generated narrative report.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.7 or above** is required.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/im-adamya-vatsalya-sharma-09/TDS-Project-2.git
cd TDS-Project-2

Usage
Running the Main Script
To execute the primary functionality of the project, run the autolysis.py script:

python autolysis.py
Expected Input
The script may require specific input files (e.g., .csv datasets) stored in the respective folders (goodreads or happiness or media).

Output
Outputs include visualizations, processed datasets, or console logs.
Check the media/ folder for graphical outputs or saved media files.

Features
1. Automated Data Analysis
autolysis.py streamlines repetitive analysis tasks.
2. Happiness Index Insights
Analyze global happiness datasets to uncover trends and patterns.
3. Goodreads Data Insights
Analyze data related to books, ratings, and reviews.
4. Visualization Outputs
